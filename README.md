# 💼 Personal Portfolio Project

## 📖 Overview
This is my first minimal personal portfolio, created as part of my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. The objective was to build a fully responsive personal portfolio webpage using only HTML and CSS that showcases my projects, skills, and contact information.

I designed this portfolio under my developer alias, Midnight Developer, to relect both my professional work and creative flair. The project demonstrates navigation structure, responsive layout, section organization, and interactive styling. This portfolio serves as my temporary developer portfolio and includes a welcome section, about section, tech stack overview, tools and platforms I use, project previews, and contact links, all presented in a clean, accessible design.
