# 💼 Personal Portfolio Webpage

## 📖 Overview
This project is part of my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

The objective was to build a Personal Portfolio Webpage using only HTML and CSS. A fully responsive site that showcases my projects, skills, and contact information while fulfilling all FreeCodeCamp’s user stories.

I designed this portfolio for my developer alias, “Midnight Developer”, to reflect both my professional work and creative flair. The project demonstrates navigation structure, responsive layout, section organization, and interactive styling.

The page serves as my developer portfolio, featuring a welcome section, about section, tech stack overview, tools I use, project previews, and contact links all in a clean, accessible design.
